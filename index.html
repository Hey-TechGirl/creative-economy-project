        <p>The main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of digitalization on SMEs and freelancer workers of creative industries. It is worth noting that in this case, the definition of digitalization used in this study goes beyond the transformation of data from the physical material into bits, such as reducing the use of paper when using applications for storing information such as spreadsheets and databases.</p>
        <p>The digitization definition used here is the ability to connect and interact information in the generation of solutions, management, organization, and creation of value through the exploitation of digital data. Moreover, when it comes to creative industry workers, the ability to increase the creativity employed in their products and services.</p>
        <p>Understanding the complexity and variety of industries in which this workforce is distributed, this research aims to try to clarify similarity and divergences in the difficulties and advantages faced by this group of people when interacting with digitization in their work tasks.</p>
